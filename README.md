# AFSK Receiver Design with Non-Coherent Demodulation

• Designed and implemented an AFSK receiver with non‑coherent demodulation for RF signal processing.

• Processed RF signals using GQRX, observed signal characteristics, and recovered audio using AM demodulation.

• Built MATLAB scripts for signal processing, including spectrum analysis, band‑pass filtering, and noise reduction.

• Applied FIR filters for tone and bits detection and reduced sampling rates for frequency band identification in noisy situations.

• Built a baseband audio‑FSK transmitter/receiver in GNU Radio and verified system operation.
